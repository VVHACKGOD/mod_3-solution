			<p>Now is the winter of our discontent
               Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
               And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
               In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
               Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
               Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
               Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
               Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
               Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
               And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
               To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
               He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
               To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
               But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
               Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
               I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
               To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
               I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
